# agent-orchestrator status

Current `main` ships a working single-user local loop: the Go daemon and the
Electron/React frontend both drive a live daemon over HTTP/SSE/WebSocket. The
core GitHub flow works end-to-end: add project → spawn session/orchestrator →
attach terminal → observe PR → merge.

## Build & test

The local gate is the backend Go build and race-enabled test suite:

```bash
cd backend && go build ./... && go test -race ./...
```

`npm run lint` (from the repo root) runs `go test ./...` plus golangci-lint.
Frontend checks live under `frontend/` (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`).
See [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for the regen workflow when touching the API
surface (`npm run sqlc`, `npm run api`).

## Shipped

### Backend (Go daemon)

- Loopback-only HTTP daemon (chi router, CORS, per-request timeout,
  `/healthz` / `/readyz` / `/shutdown`).
- SQLite store with goose migrations and sqlc-generated queries; DB
  trigger-based change-data-capture into `change_log`.
- CDC poller + broadcaster feeding in-process subscribers and the SSE stream
  at `GET /api/v1/events` (with `Last-Event-ID` replay).
- Full session lifecycle over HTTP: list, get, spawn, kill, restore, rename,
  rollback, cleanup, send, activity, PR claim/list. Orchestrator routes
  (list/spawn/get) are wired too.
- Project CRUD plus per-project config (`PUT /projects/{id}/config`).
- PR action engine wired into the API: `POST /prs/{id}/merge` and
  `/prs/{id}/resolve-comments`.
- Review routes registered: `GET /reviews`, `POST /reviews/execute`,
  `POST /reviews/{id}/send`.
- SCM observer (`internal/observe/scm`) wired into the daemon: GitHub provider,
  lazy/non-blocking auth, per-PR polling with ETag guards and semantic diffing,
  feeding PR facts into lifecycle, which sends agent nudges for CI failures,
  review feedback, and merge conflicts.
- Terminal mux over WebSocket (`/mux`): per-client `zellij attach` PTY.
- Lifecycle reducer plus reaper (`internal/observe/reaper`).
- Agent adapter platform under `internal/adapters/agent/` (20+ adapters) with a
  registry and `ao hooks` activity dispatch.
- OpenAPI spec generated from Go DTOs; frontend TS types generated from it and
  drift-checked in CI.

### Frontend (Electron + React)

- Electron + React 19 + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind + shadcn primitives.
- Real daemon wiring via the generated `openapi-fetch` typed client
  (`src/api/schema.ts`); mock data only in `VITE_NO_ELECTRON` web-preview mode.
- Electron main handles daemon discovery, launch, and status reporting.
- Shell: sidebar (projects + sessions, add/remove project), sessions board,
  session view + inspector, project settings, pull-requests page,
  spawn-orchestrator flow.
- Terminal pane (xterm) over the mux WebSocket, with a live SSE events
  connection and port-rebind on daemon restart.

## In flight / not yet a runtime feature

- **Tracker lane**: GitHub tracker adapter exists, but there is no daemon
  observer loop or agent-lifecycle→issue mirroring yet, so the tracker does
  nothing at runtime ([#112](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/112)).
- **Notifications**: design/in-flight only; no shipped backend notifier or UI
  center.
- **Live PR/tracker fact surfacing**: the observer writes facts, but exposing
  the full `pr_*` / `tracker_*` CDC events to live consumers
  ([#110](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/110)) and in
  `ao session get` ([#111](https://github.com/aoagents/agent-orchestrator/issues/111))
  is still open.
- **CLI parity for PR/review actions**: merge, resolve-comments, and review are
  HTTP-only (frontend-driven); there are no `ao pr` / `ao review` commands.
