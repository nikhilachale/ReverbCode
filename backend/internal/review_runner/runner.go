Steps:
1. Find what the PR changed: run `+"`git diff $(git merge-base HEAD origin/HEAD)...HEAD`"+` (or compare against the PR base branch) to see the diff under review.
2. Review for correctness bugs, missing error handling, security issues, test coverage, and clear deviations from the surrounding code's conventions. Prefer a few high-confidence findings over nitpicks.
3. Post your review on the PR with the GitHub CLI: `+"`gh pr review %s`"+` — use --request-changes (with a summary and inline --comment items) if it needs work, or --approve if it is ready.
4. Record the outcome with AO so the worker is nudged: write your full review to review.md, then run

     ao review submit --verdict <approved|changes_requested> --body review.md

Constraints: do not push commits, edit files, or modify the branch — review only. If you cannot determine the diff or post the review, still run `+"`ao review submit`"+` with your verdict and findings so the result is recorded.`, spec.PRURL, spec.PRURL)
